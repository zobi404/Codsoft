# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

## Introduction
This repository contains the code and documentation for a Titanic survival prediction project. The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, class, and more. I used the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers who were aboard the Titanic during its ill-fated maiden voyage.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas for data cleaning and manipulation
- Matplotlib for data visualization
- Scikit-Learn for classification modeling
- Logistic Regression model for survival prediction

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the famous Titanic dataset, which is often used for classification and machine learning tasks. It contains information about passengers, including features like:
- PassengerID
- Pclass (Ticket class)
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp (Number of siblings/spouses aboard)
- Parch (Number of parents/children aboard)
- Ticket
- Fare
- Cabin
- Embarked (Port of embarkation)

## Data Cleaning
I performed data cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and other data quality issues. This step is crucial for building a reliable machine learning model. I used the Pandas library in Python to carry out the following data cleaning tasks:
- Handling missing values
- Removing outliers
- Feature engineering (if necessary)

## Data Visualization
Data visualization is an essential part of understanding the dataset and identifying patterns. I used Matplotlib to create various plots and visualizations to gain insights into the data, such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.

## Model Building
For this project, I chose to use a Logistic Regression model for survival prediction. Logistic Regression is a common choice for binary classification problems like this one, where the goal is to predict one of two possible outcomes (survived or not survived). I trained the model on a portion of the dataset and evaluated its performance using various metrics.

## Model Evaluation
I evaluated the Logistic Regression model using the following metrics:
- Accuracy Score: This metric measures the overall correctness of the model's predictions.
- F1 Score: The F1 score is a combination of precision and recall, and it is particularly useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets.
- Log Loss: Logarithmic loss measures the performance of a classification model where the predicted output is a probability value.

## Results
I achieved an impressive 100% accuracy score on my model. However, it's important to note that achieving such high accuracy can sometimes indicate overfitting or data leakage. Further analysis and cross-validation may be necessary to ensure the model's robustness.

## Conclusion
This Titanic survival prediction project demonstrates the use of Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-Learn for data analysis and machine learning. While I achieved a high accuracy score, it's essential to conduct further investigations to ensure the model's generalization to new, unseen data. This project can serve as a foundation for more advanced machine learning and feature engineering techniques to improve predictive performance.
